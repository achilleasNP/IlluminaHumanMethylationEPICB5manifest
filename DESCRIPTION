Description: This is a drop in replacement IlluminaHumanMethylationEPIC package providing a Manifest based on 1.0B5 annotation. The IlluminaHumanMethylationEPIC package by  Author: Kasper Daniel Hansen [cre, aut] as of version 0.3.0 still uses the manifest based 1.0B2 annotation. There is a companion annotation package: IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b5.hg38. To provide the appropriate annotation. The choice to use the same name is because some of the preproces options use an array name lookup and using a different created a problem in downstream processing.
